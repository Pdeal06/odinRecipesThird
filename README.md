So I am going to finish Odin properly this time. I'm running through the beginning parts to refresh my memory and this will be last time I complete this project. 

I got distracted, but I'm back focused and I'm reminded of the importance of tackling one problem at a time opposed to trying to skip ahead and solve multiple simultaneously.
