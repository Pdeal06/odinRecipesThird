  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>These Asian chicken thighs are slightly spicy but the sweetness tames the heat. Delicious served with rice.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
    <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons honey</li>
    <li>¼ cup Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons Asian chili garlic sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>8  skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chicken in a large glass or ceramic bowl. </li>
    <li>Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger for marinade together in a small bowl; pour over chicken and toss to evenly coat. </li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Combine mayonnaise, sesame oil, sugar, and ginger for dressing in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate while you cook the chicken.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. </li>
    <li> Remove from the grill and chop when cool enough to handle.</li>
    <li>While the chicken is cooking, place sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium-high heat. Shake the pan like you are making popcorn and toast until seeds give off a lovely toasted smell, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Quickly remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool; if you leave them in the pan they will continue to cook and burn.</li>
    <li>Place napa cabbage, green cabbage, and carrot in a large bowl with chicken and toasted sesame seeds. Toss together, then mix in the dressing.</li>
  </ol>
