  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Flavorful and so delicious, this sesame chicken salad will wow you! </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    <li>1 medium head napa cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot, shredded</li>
    <li>½ cup crispy fried rice noodles</li>

  </ul>

  <h3> Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chicken in a large glass or ceramic bowl. </li>
    <li>Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger for marinade together in a small bowl; pour over chicken and toss to evenly coat. </li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Combine mayonnaise, sesame oil, sugar, and ginger for dressing in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate while you cook the chicken.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. </li>
    <li> Remove from the grill and chop when cool enough to handle.</li>
    <li>While the chicken is cooking, place sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium-high heat. Shake the pan like you are making popcorn and toast until seeds give off a lovely toasted smell, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Quickly remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool; if you leave them in the pan they will continue to cook and burn.</li>
    <li>Place napa cabbage, green cabbage, and carrot in a large bowl with chicken and toasted sesame seeds. Toss together, then mix in the dressing.</li>
  </ol>
